# Fast(er) Walsh&ndash;Hadamard Transform

A high-performance implementation of *Faster Walsh&ndash;Hadamard and Discrete Fourier Transforms From Matrix Non-Rigidity* by Josh Alman and Kevin Rao [DOI](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3564246.3585188). For an array for lenght $N = 2^n$, this method uses only $\left( \frac{7}{8} \log_2 (N) + O(1) \right) N$ additions and $O(N)$ elementary binary operations. Written in C++, using OpenMP and Pybind11.

Note: The current version only works with integer arrays. Float implementation to be added later.

## Installation

You can install the package directly from GitHub using pip:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/akos-nagy/faster_walsh_hadamard_transform.git
```

## Usage Example

Below is a simple example of how to use the library:

```python
from faster_walsh_hadamard_transform import fwht
import numpy as np

# Create an array of random integers with length 2^4 = 16
data = np.random.randint(- 10, 10, 1 << 3)
# Example array:
# data = [ 3,  8,  9,  8, -8,  3,  9,  7]

# Compute the Walshâ€“Hadamard Transform
result = fwht(data)
# Example output:
# result = [ 39, -13, -27, -19,  17,   5,  15,   7]
print("Original again\t= ", data)  # Should remain unchanged
print("Transformed\t= ", result)  # Transformed output
```
